To implement the changes described, I first added a player 1 and 2 plus their match counts into the html. I gave each of these elements an ID. By putting them in the game-info div, I did not have to change CSS. Then, I grabbed these elements in the js file and created a new variable named player. I created a changePlayer function to display the current player by highlighting it pink and used this whenever a match was failed, and I added logic to increment the correct player's score after a match was made in the checkMatch function. I was able to do these things without asking ChatGPT.
